# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: PAIRED trains an agent to generate environments that maximize regret between a pair of learning agents. This creates feasible yet challenging environments, which exploit weaknesses in the agents to make them more robust. PAIRED significantly improves generalization to novel tasks.
