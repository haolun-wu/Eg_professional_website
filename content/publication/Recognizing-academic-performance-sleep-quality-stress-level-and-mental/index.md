abstract: "What can wearable sensors and usage of smart phones tell us about academic performance, self-reported sleep quality, stress and mental health condition? To answer this question, we collected extensive subjective and objective data using mobile phones, surveys, and wearable sensors worn day and night from 66 participants, for 30 days each, totaling 1,980 days of data. We analyzed daily and monthly behavioral and physiological patterns and identified factors that affect academic performance (GPA), Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score, perceived stress scale (PSS), and mental health composite score (MCS) from SF-12, using these month-long data. We also examined how accurately the collected data classified the participants into groups of high/low GPA, good/poor sleep quality, high/low self-reported stress, high/low MCS using feature selection and machine learning techniques. We found associations among PSQI, PSS, MCS, and GPA and personality types. Classification accuracies using the objective data from wearable sensors and mobile phones ranged from 67â€“92%."


# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: SNAPSHOT was a large-scale study of college undergraduates which tracked detailed longitudinal data from smartphones, wearable sensors, behavioral data, and mental health and sleep quality surveys. This initial study analyzed relationships between sleep quality, stress, and GPA, and used machine learning to predict these indices from objective phone and sensor data.
