abstract: "In this paper we investigate the usefulness of eye tracking data for predicting emotions relevant to learning, specifically boredom and curiosity. The data was collected during a study with MetaTutor, an intelligent tutoring system (ITS) designed to promote the use of self-regulated learning strategies. We used a variety of machine learning and feature selection techniques to predict studentsâ€™ self-reported emotions from gaze data features. We examined the optimal amount of interaction time needed to make predictions, as well as which features are most predictive of each emotion. The findings provide insight into how to detect when students disengage from MetaTutor."

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: Using eye-tracking data collected while students interact with an Intelligent Tutoring System, we train machine learning models to predict when students are experiencing boredom and curiosity. Which analyze which features are most relevant to detecting when students are engaged and curious vs. disengaged and bored.
