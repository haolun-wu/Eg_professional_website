abstract: "In this work we introduce an experimental methodology and open-sourced web application designed to promote behavior change and wellbeing within a workplace environment. Colleagues are paired together and asked to design a Behavioral Intervention Technology (BIT) uniquely customized to suit their partner’s behavior change goal. We present the results of a preliminary evaluation of the experiment, and suggest ways to further improve and expand our experiment design."
# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: To help promote behavior change, we leverage the power of social obligation, and conduct an experiment in which participants are paired together and asked to design a Behavioral Intervention Technology (BIT) customized to suit their partner’s behavior change goal.
