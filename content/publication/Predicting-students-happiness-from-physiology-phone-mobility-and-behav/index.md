abstract: "In order to model studentsâ€™ happiness, we apply machine learning methods to data collected from undergrad students monitored over the course of one month each. The data collected include physiological signals, location, smartphone logs, and survey responses to behavioral questions. Each day, participants reported their wellbeing on measures including stress, health, and happiness. Because of the relationship between happiness and depression, modeling happiness may help us to detect individuals who are at risk of depression and guide interventions to help them. We are also interested in how behavioral factors (such as sleep and social activity) affect happiness positively and negatively. A variety of machine learning and feature selection techniques are compared, including Gaussian Mixture Models and ensemble classification. We achieve 70% classification accuracy of self-reported happiness on held-out test data."

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: "We train machine learning models to predict students' happiness from extensive data comprising physiological signals, location, smartphone logs, and behavioral questions. Analyzing which features provide the highest information gain reveals that skin conductance during sleep, social interaction, exercise, and fewer phone screen hours are all positively associated with happiness."
