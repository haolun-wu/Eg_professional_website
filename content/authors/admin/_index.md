I was born and grew up in [Chengdu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chengdu), one of the most prosperous cities in Asia with a 4,000-year history of human habitation. I spent my first 18 years in my hometown before traveling to different places around the world. 

I am a Ph.D. candidate at [McGill University](https://www.mcgill.ca/about/history) and [Mila](https://mila.quebec/en/) (the world's largest AI community led by [Yoshua Bengio](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=kukA0LcAAAAJ&hl=en)). I am delighted in working with [Xue (Steve) Liu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=rfLIRakAAAAJ&hl=en), [Joelle Pineau](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=CEt6_mMAAAAJ&hl=en), and [Laurent Charlin](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Cul0g2YAAAAJ&hl=en).
I am also honored to collaborate closely [Fernando Diaz](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=212SLn0AAAAJ&hl=en) and have him on my supervisory committee.
My research interests include: Information Retrieval, Recommender System, Fairness, Continual Learning, etc.
I am committed to using advanced AI techniques to benefit social goods and aid human decision-making.
