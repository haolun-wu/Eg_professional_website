Social learning helps humans and animals rapidly adapt to new circumstances, and drives the emergence of complex learned behaviors. My research is focused on **Social Reinforcement Learning**---developing RL algorithms that use insights from social learning to improve RL agents' [learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.02096), [generalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.00581), [coordination](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.08647), and [human-AI interaction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.05848). 

I currently hold a joint position as a Research Scientist at Google Brain and Postdoctoral Fellow at UC Berkeley. I received my PhD from MIT, where I worked on Affective Computing and deep/reinforcement/machine learning. My work has received the best demo award at NeurIPS 2016, best paper at the NeurIPS workshops on ML for Healthcare and Cooperative AI, and an honourable mention for best paper at ICML 2019; it has also been features in Science Magazine, Quartz, MIT Technology Review, Boston Magazine, and on CBC radio.  I have interned at DeepMind, Google Brain, and worked as an OpenAI Scholars mentor. 
<!--I earned my Masters degree from the University of British Columbia, and undergraduate degrees in Computer Science and Psychology from the University of Regina.-->
